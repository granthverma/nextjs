Node.js is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It allows the creation of scalable Web servers without threading and networking tools using JavaScript and a collection of “modules” that handle various core functionalities. It can make console-based and web-based node.js applications. 

Datatypes: Node.js contains various types of data types similar to JavaScript.

Boolean

Loose Typing: Node.js supports loose typing, which means you don’t need to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. We use the var and let keywords in Node.js declare any type of variable. Examples are given belo


Node.js is an open source, cross-platform server environment which executes JavaScript using V8 JavaScript Engine. Node.js helps to write front-end and back-end code in the same language. It helps to write efficient code for real-time applications. In Node.js, the applications can be written using console-based method or web-based method.

Console based Node.js Application: The Node.js console-based applications are run using Node.js command prompt. Console module in Node.js provide a simple debugging console. Node.js is a global console which can be used for synchronous as well as asynchronous communication. The console.log() function is used to display output on console. This function prints output to stdout with newline.
